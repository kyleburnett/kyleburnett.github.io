My name is Kyle Burnett. I was born and raised in Orlando, FL, where I still live and work. I love Orlando because it has everything you could want in a city. It's a city with good food, plenty of entertainment options, and educational hubs.

I graduated from the University of Central Florida in May 2015 with my master's degree in computer science and currently work for [Elekta](https://www.elekta.com/) as an engineer. I like solving problems and working to make a difference in the lives of cancer patients.

I am a Christian and enjoy volunteering at my church. My wife and I have been married since October 22, 2016. We love to travel, play board games, and spend time with friends and family.
