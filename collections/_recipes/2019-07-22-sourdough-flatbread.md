    The inspiration for this recipe was the [The Complete Cooking for Two Cookbook](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B00JEOMV1E&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_dB-gDbSRRKBJP), which includes a recipe for making dough for a single pizza. Instead of going from dry ingredients and slowing adding wet ingredients until a dough forms, this recipe starts from a wet sourdough starter and becomes a dough as more flour is added.

    The feature image to the left is a barbecue chicken flatbread.

    * 100 g sourdough starter
    * 1 tbsp olive oil
    * 1/2 tsp salt
    * 5-7 tbsp flour
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Combine the starter, olive oil, salt, and 5 tbsp of flour into the bowl of a stand mixer and begin to combine together using the dough hook attachment on low speed.
    2. Continue to add flour 1 tbsp at a time until the dough ball comes together into a resilient dough that cleans the side of the bowl.
    3. Place dough into an oiled bowl and set aside in a warm place to rest for 8-12 hours.
    4. Preheat your oven to 400&deg; F with a baking stone set on the middle rack.
    5. Roll out the dough on a sheet of parchment paper until it measures about 10-12 inches in diameter.
    6. Bake the dough onto a baking stone for about 8 min or until the bubbles and edges begin to brown slightly.

    I like to store my prebaked flatbread in a 2-gallon sized bag until I'm ready to use it. When I'm ready to use it, I just defrost it, add the toppings, and bake until the toppings are done (e.g., the cheese is melted).
