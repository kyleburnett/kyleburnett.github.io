    This recipe is courtesy of my mom, Kelly Burnett. It's a family favorite&mdash;particularly around Christmas. Here are three tips from my mom for making perfect cookies every time:
    1. Hand mix everything. Using a mixer produces overworked dough and flat cookies.
    2. Don't use melted butter. Let the butter come to room temperature naturally or microwave for just a few seconds at a time until soft.
    3. Line the cookie sheets with parchment paper.

    **Baking Cookies**
    1. Cream together the first 4 ingredients: brown sugar, granulated sugar, butter, and salt. Use a pastry blender or a large fork for best results.
    2. Add the remaining dough ingredients&mdash;add the flour one cup at a time to make mixing easier&mdash;and mix well with a wooden spoon.
    3. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
    4. Bake at 350&deg;F for 12 minutes.
    5. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 1-2 minutes, and then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before icing.

    **Icing Cookies**
    1. Measure out 1 cup or more of powdered sugar into a small bowl.
    2. Slowly add pineapple juice and melted butter in small amounts until icing is desired smoothness and consistency.
    3. Ice cookies once they have cooled completely.
