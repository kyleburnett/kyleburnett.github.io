The following is a reproduction of the handwritten World War 2 diary of my grandfather, James Thomas Burnett, Sr. The diary runs from January 1942 through October 1942. I want to extend special thanks to my parents, James (JT) Burnett and Kelly Burnett, for digitizing this valuable piece of family history. Some entries contained indecipherable words. In places where the entry was difficult to read, my parents were able to provide an educated guess, typically denoted by a question mark. In cases where this was not possible, underscores were used to represent these unknown words.

# January 1942

## Thursday, January 1

December 8, the US declared war on Japan. I have been thinking what role I would play in this war. December 26, we were told that our air base is leaving on a long voyage as soon as we get packed up.

## Friday, January 2

We are working night and day getting our stuff packed which is quite a lot. By tomorrow we will be packed ready to load on flat cars. No one is allowed to leave the base.

## Saturday, January 3

We are working all day to get our trucks loaded. Everyone is restricted to the base, even the officers. There is a big crowd at the gate as everybody is meeting their sweethearts and relatives, the last time, a long time.

## Sunday, January 4

We rested Sunday AM. At 1 PM Sunday, we said goodbye to West Palm Beach, loaded on pullman train, leaving under sealed orders. There were large crowds to see us off from Morrison Field past West Palm Beach.

## Monday, January 5

We passed through Pensacola this AM and towns of Alabama and along the coast of Mississippi. By night we were in New Orleans. I was on k.p. on the train which was a snap.

## Tuesday, January 6

We passed through Arkansas in the night and arrived in Houston early this AM. We got off the train here and had a 10-minute exercise period. Sure was cold outside the train and looks like rain.

We arrived in Los Angeles early this AM. We traveled through valley country of California as well as on the coast. We’ve seen a lot of oil wells drilled in the ocean. We arrived in Frisco late this PM.

## Friday, January 9

Last night we hiked from the train to the international livestock pavilion which is a very large building. Our company was assigned to a small portion near the bull ring. We slept nearly all the AM as we were very tired last night. There is a lot of soldiers here.

## Saturday, January 10

I went on pass last night to downtown Frisco. Took in the night clubs. This AM we went to the presido to be examined. We had a concert and show by Hollywood actors sponsored by USO Red Cross.

## Sunday, January 11

We had church inside the building which we call the cow palace. I took a hike around the building and on the mountain adjoining which has a commanding view of the city. This PM we got our stuff together and loaded on board the SS Mariposa, a luxury liner.

## Monday, January 12

Last night we were assigned to state rooms which were very nice. I took a look around the ship which is well armored with cannons and machine guns and also loaded with plane boxes. We sailed at 12 noon, passed under the golden gate bridge.

## Tuesday, January 13

Some of the boys were getting seasick last night. I have been lucky as I haven’t been seasick yet and I hope I don’t this time. The sea is calm this AM. There are 7 ships in the convoy besides our ship.

## Wednesday, January 14

The sea is rougher this AM and the sky is clear. We are running in a zig zag position southwest. Two of our ships left us. There are 5 ships in the convoy, the Monroe, the President Coolidge, and the Cruiser Phoenix, a destroyer, and our ship.

## Thursday, January 15

The sea is still. It is warmer. There is approximately 4000 soldiers on the Mariposa, over 4000 on the Coolidge, including 200 nurses, and 2000 on the Monroe. All ships are blacked out at night. We had a lifeboat drill today.

## Friday, January 16

The sea is still rough and some boys are still sea sick. That leaves more chow for the rest of us. Planes are lowered by crane off the Cruiser Phoenix and patrol the area ahead.

## Saturday, January 17

The other destroyer left us this AM. The Phoenix was in Pearl Harbor during the bombing but got out in a hurry. We lost an hour today which makes 4 hours difference between here and West Palm Beach.

## Sunday, January 18

We had church on board ship. There are rumors we are going to Australia. We passed about 300 miles off the Hawaiian Islands. It is getting warmer as we are getting nearer to the equator.

## Friday, January 23

It sure is getting hot. It’s even hot in the state rooms which are air conditioned. The only place that it is cool, is out on deck which I sleep on frequently. There was a British Cruiser with us today, all painted up like a dragon.

## Saturday, January 24

We passed the equator today. Sure is hot. The sea is calm. Just like glass. There is hardly any breeze. The ship is doing 18 knots per hour. The clocks were turned back an hour; makes 4 hours from Frisco.

## Sunday, January 25

We had church today. Although we passed the international date line which puts the clocks a full day ahead, which makes today Monday. Which means instead of us being 7 hours behind West Palm Beach, we are 17 hours ahead.

# February 1942

## Sunday, February 1

I was awakened this AM by the shouts, “Land to the starboard side!” I looked out the porthole to see a rugged range of mountains with patrol bombers flying over. Then you can see the mainland to the port side. We arrived in Melbourne Bay at 8 PM.

## Monday, February 2

This AM I took a good look at the city through glasses which is a beautiful city. Docked at 10 AM. Entrained, stopped uptown, had lunch. We entrained for Baccus Marsh. Everyone was waving and shouting, “the Yanks are here!” Monday the 2nd we hiked from Baccus Marsh to Camp Darley. Everyone was ready to drop when we got there. Camp Darley is on a high plateau near a ring of mountains.

## Tuesday, February 3

We recuperated from the long hike from Baccus Marsh as loss of a lots of sleep. I looked about the camp which has a deep valley west with cattle ranches and orchards of peaches and other fruit all around.

## Wednesday, February 4

Three of us hiked into the valley below camp. We stopped at a farmer’s house who invited us in, gave us milk and all kinds of fruit and told us to come again. I’ve never seen so many rabbits in my life.

## Thursday, February 5

Some of us went to Baccus Marsh to look over the town abounded in orchards and arbors and gardens. It is summer here but it is cool at night. The days are pleasant. The Aussies like American soldiers very much. Met lots of people.

## Friday, February 6

## Monday, February 16

The sea is rough. It is cold every AM in the machine gun nest. We passed a couple of ships. The cruiser made a beeline for them so they must have been allied ships. Our destination is supposed to be Java.

We went ashore again. I was invited to a party by a girl I met last night. The people are enthusiastic over the American soldiers and just as nice as they were at Melbourne. The report came out this AM that Darwin Australia was bombed.

## Friday, February 20

I awoke to find our ship was moving out in mid harbor so another ship could come in. The port of Fremantle is small and usually there is ships outside waiting their turn to come into port.

Our boat is still anchored in the harbor. The aircraft carrier Langley which came in yesterday, is being loaded with p40 planes assembled. Our ship is being loaded with water and food supplies.

## Friday, August 21

I witnessed the most spectacular and horrible thing I’ve ever seen. A test pilot in a P 66 was doing everything that could be done with a plane, flying 5 feet off the ground and doing 90 degree banks, one after another. He done a steep bank very low. He lost altitude. He struck the 51st P outdoor movie screen, hit three tents and tore them down, skidded into a gulley. The plane caught fire. Some shouted for help but no one could rescue him as the plane was in a gulch of fire. He was burned up terrible.

They were given orders to bail out. They refused saying they had brought it from the states and he wasn’t going to leave it. He circled the field for one hour. Put all the baggage on the other side. Came in low and fast. Landed on the tricycle and right wheel. Started making a circle to the right. He was still going quite fast. It went in ?  to some P40s and stopped about 15 feet from P4s. He landed it without loss of life and slight damage to one wing and prop.
